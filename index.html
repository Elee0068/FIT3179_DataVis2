      <h1>From Droughts to Deluge</h1>
      <br>
      <p>In 2022, global wine production reached <span style="color: #851891; font-weight: bold;">258 million hectoliters</span> (mhl), with a slight <span style="color: #910303; font-weight: bold;">1% decrease</span> from the previous year. Europe managed to maintain production levels despite challenges like <span style="color: #910303; font-weight: bold;">heatwaves and droughts</span>, led by Italy, France, and Spain, which saw a <span style="color: #851891; font-weight: bold;">notable 21% increase</span>. Germany also grew, while other EU nations faced declines.</p> 
      <p>Outside the EU, Russia and Georgia increased production, but Moldova and Switzerland saw declines. In Asia, China's wine production <span style="color: #910303; font-weight: bold;">dropped by 29%</span>. North America faced challenges, resulting in a <span style="color: #910303; font-weight: bold;">7% decrease</span> in US production. Overall, 2022 showcased the wine industry's resilience in the face of <span style="color: #910303; font-weight: bold;">diverse climatic challenges</span> and success stories across the globe.</p>

      <h1>Global Wine Consumption in Flux</h1>
      <p>In 2022, global wine consumption witnessed a <span style="color: #910303; font-weight: bold;">1% decrease</span>, totaling <span style="color: #851891; font-weight: bold;">223 million hectoliters</span> (mhl), continuing a declining trend that began in 2018. The primary driver of this trend was the consistent reduction in wine consumption in China, which had been decreasing by 2 mhl annually since 2018, with the <span style="color: #910303; font-weight: bold;">COVID-19 pandemic</span> in 2020 further amplifying the decline.</p>

      <h1>Global Wine Trade in Turmoil</h1>
      <p>In the realm of international wine trade, 2022 bore the brunt of formidable challenges. After the disruptions caused by the <span style="color: #910303; font-weight: bold;">COVID-19 pandemic</span> in 2020, a year of <span style="color: #851891; font-weight: bold;">record-high exports</span> seemed to signal recovery.</p>
        <p>However, the wine trade was severely impacted by the war in Ukraine and a <span style="color: #910303; font-weight: bold;">global energy crisis</span> that spurred inflation across major economies. Furthermore, 2022 was marked by significant <span style="color: #910303; font-weight: bold;">supply chain disruptions</span>, causing a slowdown in sea freight.</p> 
          <p>These combined events led to a <span style="color: #910303; font-weight: bold;">reduction in volume</span> of wine exports, but the silver lining was a substantial increase in average prices, <span style="color: #851891; font-weight: bold;">soaring by 9%</span> compared to 2021. Consequently, the global wine export value reached an all-time high of <span style="color: #851891; font-weight: bold;">37.6 billion EUR</span>.</p>
